    "Building a platform and business like DataBroker DAO requires real sellers and buyers of IoT sensor data. Over the past couple of months we have been hard at work integrating these parties into an alliance. Today we are proud to announce the below members have joined the DataBroker DAO alliance. And more to come!",
  "alliance_quote":
    "\"We are happy to cross paths with SettleMint and to engage with blockchain technology over DataBroker DAO. The integration was smooth and successful due to technical excellence. In a next step on our roadmap we intend to include a DataBrokerDAO “sell my data” option into our portfolio, as we realise this is a new monetisation opportunity for both sensor owners, data consumers and vendors\", said mr. Rajeev Jha - CEO of Yuktix",

    "On the buyer side of things we find the SENTHUS consortium from our homeland Belgium. The SENTHUS consortium is, supported by the Brussels regions minister of economy, working to make the capital city of Brussels (both of the country and of the entire European Union) a smarter city.",

    "YUKTIX is an IoT sensor manufacturer, based in Bangalore, India. The company creates next generation information systems for agriculture and environmental Monitoring. YUKTIX solutions can be used by farmers, growers, cooperatives and contractors or in Smart Cities to drive best practices, conserve resources and improve operation efficiency. YUKTIX provides a complete end-to-end solution. Meaning, just turn “ON” the sensor nodes and collect data on the YUKTIX SensorDB. Data distribution is also made possible via webhooks and REST API’s.\n\nWhich is how they tie in to the DataBroker DAO marketplace, offering their customers an easy path to recoup some or even all of the costs of their purchases.",

    "Individuals, companies, researchers & governments are spending hundreds of billions each year on buying and maintaining IoT sensors. The growth of the investment and applications in IoT is truly staggering, and yet, all data captured by these devices is locked up in silos and walled gardens. On its path from sensor to silo, all this data flows over gateway operators like telecom companies, networks and even the control panels of the sensor manufacturers. These sensor owners usually have a two year business case for their placement and the data they generate. The primary market for these sensors is expected to reach 1.2 trillion USD in 2019, and estimating that at least 10% of the data generated is sought for others (1-3 times), the value of data locked away will reach 120 billion next year!",
