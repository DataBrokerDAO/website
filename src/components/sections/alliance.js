                      Belgium-based software company Esoptra delivers customized
                      information access and integration solutions as a service.
                      Their innovative IPaaS platform uses so called ‘pluglits’
                      to provide a new array of data access and migration
                      services. These pluglits are tiny data connectors
                      ‘scraping’ data from its sources, only when the
                      destination (data) file gets consulted. Thus eliminating
                      the need for intermediate storage and useless data
                      migration. At a fraction of the usual cost, deployed in
                      hours or days instead of weeks or months, deployed on
                      premise or in any cloud, and rendered on any mobile or
                      desktop device. By joining the DataBroker DAO alliance,
                      Esoptra gets access to a blockchain based layer to
                      monetize their services.

                      The shares rise in value with demand, and demand is tied
                      to active local support.
